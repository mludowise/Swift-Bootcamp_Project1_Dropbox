Notes:

Took a bit of troubleshooting to get the back buttons to work properly for welcome from every screen. Ended up not making the Sign In and Account Creation views separate, but rather kept them as one view and changed the background image programatically.

Also spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to get the Sign Out to go to the Logged Out screen rather than jumping to the account creation screen, but Tim said we don't have to do that via FB group.
